# YouTube UI Clone 📺

This project is a static clone of the YouTube homepage, created to replicate the platform's user interface using only HTML and CSS. It's a front-end exercise designed to practice layout, styling, and structural design without any backend functionality.

The clone features a responsive header, a navigation sidebar, and a dynamic grid of video thumbnails. All the video content, including thumbnails and channel information, is from my personal YouTube channel, **Tech View JD**.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Header:** Includes the YouTube logo, a functional search bar, and user action icons.
* **Navigation Sidebar:** A collapsible sidebar with links to Home, Explore, Subscriptions, and other user-specific pages, mimicking YouTube's own navigation.
* **Video Grid:** A clean, grid-based layout displaying video thumbnails, titles, channel names, and view counts.
* **Real Content:** The video thumbnails and titles are from my actual tech channel, [Tech View JD](https://www.youtube.com/@techviewjd5648), and each video links to its real page on YouTube.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and layout of the page.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including flexbox for layout, custom fonts (Roboto), and hover effects.
* **Material Icons:** Used for all the icons throughout the interface.
